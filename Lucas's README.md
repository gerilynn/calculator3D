THREE.JS

Lucas Solanik and Geri Viallon

Group Number 22

We took a deep dive into Three.js, exploring what it is, how it works, and its implementation. Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and API designed to make using WebGL more effective and easier. WebGL is responsible for rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics without the use of plugins, created specifically for the web, which contributes to Three.js's effectiveness in web applications. Our application showcases the "Hello World" of the Three.js framework, featuring a simple webpage demonstrating three basic uses of the Three.js framework. The First Mod involves building a cube that spins on the x, y, and z axes. The Second Mod uses the same code but adds a light, casting shadows and revealing only the sides of the cube facing the light. The Third Mod incorporates an Addon allowing user interaction: scrolling zooms in and out, clicking and dragging moves the cube, and right-clicking and dragging rotates the camera around the cube.

We aimed to deepen our understanding of Three.js, its workings, and its best use cases. Working for a company that frequently utilizes Three.js, I sought to explore it further, while Geri had a desire to enhance her knowledge. Our goal was to comprehend the difficulty involved in building these new interactive websites that are gaining attention.

Three.js is a potent and widely-used JavaScript library for crafting 3D graphics in web browsers. It simplifies the complexities of WebGL, offering developers a higher-level abstraction for creating immersive and interactive 3D experiences. At its core, Three.js revolves around scenes, cameras, and objects. Developers can construct 3D scenes by adding objects such as meshes, lights, and cameras, enabling the creation of visually stunning virtual environments. The library also supports various materials and shaders to enhance object appearances, along with animation capabilities for dynamic and engaging content. Three.js is versatile, catering to applications from simple 3D visualizations to complex virtual reality experiences.

When working with Three.js, having the right development tools is crucial for efficiency. Vite, a fast and lightweight build tool for modern web development, is often highlighted. Vite's quick development server and seamless hot module replacement streamline the development process. With Vite, developers can leverage ES modules for a modular and clean code structure. The combination of Three.js and Vite offers a streamlined workflow, enabling developers to focus on the creative aspects of 3D design and interaction without being bogged down by intricate low-level WebGL details. Additionally, Three.js provides a comprehensive set of APIs for handling user input, managing scenes, and implementing animations, empowering developers to create engaging 3D web applications with ease.

Geri was a fantastic team member and handled a significant portion of the coding work for this project. She initiated the setup of our public GitHub repo, bringing over her code from a previous project. Geri then expanded on it by incorporating the basic Three.js code. While the code was fundamental, its implementation was not easy for Geri and required refinement. After getting the cube to spin, she added the next scene with a light. I then contributed to the third scene, involving code reorganization, and adding lines of code to enable user interaction. Once the website was complete, we collaborated on building the slideshow, each contributing sections of code pivotal to the scene's functionality. We discovered that while the Three.js website is an excellent resource for understanding the framework, it's not a simple copy-and-paste situation. Successful implementation requires coding knowledge and insight.

While it would have been intriguing to delve even deeper into Three.js, I am proud of the work we accomplished. As mentioned earlier, copying and pasting from the Three.js website was a difficult process, and in future projects, we might consider using the site as a only a reference. This approach could make it easier to modify the code. This project has heightened my interest in Three.js, and I plan to continue using and learning it as I believe it is a valuable tool.

The url above will take you to our website that is hosted on the school server, however none of the Three.js files uploaded. I used FileZilla to transfer all my files and when I inspect the page, the Three.js sources do not appear. I talked to Riley about this and he could not figure it out either. I have submitted a video of the site working on my local machine but I can not get it to work on the school server.
